Welcome to this C++ tutorial !
In this tutorial, you'll see the basics of the C++ language.
I'm not gonna talk about C++'s history, so let's start now !

C++ is a fast object oriented programming language. It is compiled (!= interpreted) which means that you can create an executable file without needing an interpreter.

An interperter is an application that basically reads each line of your code and executes them one by one.
This type of language is slow because the code is compiled at execution time, which means that each line is compiled when it is read by the interpreter.
Also, if there's an error at a certain line of your code, it will execute all the previous instructions and throw an exception that will stop the program at least as it reaches this specific line.
Examples of interpreted languages are Python and Java.

A compiled language is a language that is directly compiled into machine code. It doesn't need an interpreter or anything like that to run.
You need a compiler to compile your program into machine code (obviously).
Compiled languages are faster than interpreted languages. However, some interpreted languages are faster than others : Java is a lot faster than Python but the syntax is not as easy as Python's one is.
Also, compiled languages use a most complex syntax than interpreted ones, but it's not difficult at all. Java's syntax is actually close to compiled languages syntax.
Most of your computer apps are coded in C/C++, Java, C# (litteraly a mix of java and C++ created by Microsoft). Python would be too slow.
For example, videogames that require a lot of performances are coded in C++, but for something that doesn't require too much performance, you can use C# or Java.
For example, Minecraft Java Edition is coded in Java (obviously), you can create really cool videogames for pc mobile, and other systems with C# using Unity (like fall guys), and you can create very cool videogames with C++ using Unreal Engine (like Fortnite)
